Usage Statistics sends a small anonymous report once a day so the Termix team can see how Termix is used: which platforms it runs on, which features people open, which plugins are on. It helps decide what to work on.

It never sends usernames, hostnames, commands or credentials. Like any web request, the analytics service can see the IP address your server sends from.

## What is sent

Admins choose in **Settings**, **Usage Statistics**:

| Setting                        | Sends                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Include platform info**      | Operating system, CPU architecture, Node.js version, database type, and how Termix is installed (Docker, desktop app or server). |
| **Include feature usage**      | How many times each kind of tab was opened and how many SSH logins happened since the last report.                               |
| **Include installed features** | Which plugins are on and their versions.                                                                                         |

Each report also carries the Termix version and a random **Instance ID**, so one install's reports can be counted together. **Reset instance ID** makes a new one.

Each user can leave their own tab counts out with **Include my feature usage** in their settings.

## See it first

**Preview report** shows exactly what the next report contains. **Send now** sends one straight away.

## Turn it off

Turn off **Share anonymous usage statistics**, or uninstall the plugin. To lock it from the environment, set `ENABLE_TELEMETRY=false`. Then the setting can't be changed in the app.

During first-run setup, admins can also turn it off on the plugin picker.

## Where it goes

Reports go to Termix's [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) project. To send them to your own PostHog instead, set `POSTHOG_API_KEY` and `POSTHOG_HOST`.

The code that builds the report is in this plugin's repo, so you can read exactly what it does.
